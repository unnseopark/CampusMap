# CampusMap
## Description
Commuting to class can be boring, time-consuming, stressful, or confusing especially if youâ€™re unfamiliar with campus. Often, there are hidden shortcuts between buildings that google maps and most people do not know of. Our game: CampusMap solves this issue by turning the task of navigating between buildings on campus into a game. This game motivates students to find the optimized route by competing with others.

## Technologies Used
A prototype Android app developed in Kotlin for users to find the shortest route between two locations on campus. Using the
Google Maps API, the app measures the distance the user walks to reach the destination from the starting point. The leaderboard
displays the shortest paths that other users took.
